I'll ask nicely
I'll be back
I'll get right on it
I'll let you know
I'll think about it
I'm God and you're not
I'm God who the heck are you
I'm beginning to wonder
I'm bored
I'm busy
I'm done
I'm feeling nice today
I'm gonna smack someone
I'm good you good
I'm grieved
I'm impressed
I'm in suspense
I'm not dead yet
I'm not sure
I'm off today
I'm on a roll
I'm the boss
I'm thrilled
I'm tired of this
IMHO
I am not amused
I be like
I can't believe it
I could be wrong
I could swear
I didn't do it
I didn't see that
I don't care
I donno
I forgot
I give up
I got your back
I had a crazy dream
I hate when that happens
I have an idea
I just might
I love this
I love you
I made it that way
I pity the fool
I planned that
I quit
I see nothing
I veto that
I was just thinking
I was sleeping

Cat got your tongue?
Technology is the future
Decentralized finance will take over
The private sector will triumph over the government
Go touch some grass.
Linux is superior to windows.
Children nowadays are stupid.
Dark times are ahead.
Why even try?
Get back to work.
Do better

No racism please.
You don't lose if you don't play.
I never listen lately.
Do you live here or is this a vacation?
yeah
yep
yikes
you'll see
you're fired
you're in big trouble
you're lucky
you're no fun
you're not all there are you
you're nuts
you're out of your mind
you're so screwed
you're welcome
you're wonderful
you better not
you do it
you don't like it
you don't say
you know a better God
you never know
you owe me
you see the light
you should be so lucky
you shouldn't have
you talkin' to me
you think I'm joking
you think you could do better
Web5 is coming.
You can't stop it now.
I feel like god.
I AM god.
I'm the best.
It's not ego if you are actually smarter than the other person. 
Radical accelerationism is the only path forward.
Capitalism isn't great, but I don't fancy calling people comrade.
You know, I'm starting to think mankind isn't so cut out for this whole ruling the world thing.
Free t-shirts? I'm in.
Big tech is evil, but we can't live without it. 
I'm better than you.
I'm smarter than you.
Nothing personal.
Don't feel bad.
Skill issue.
L, sucks to suck.
Satanic worship? Count me in.
